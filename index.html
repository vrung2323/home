My name is Varun Gande. Iâ€™m an undergraduate student at Cornell University studying Operations Research and Computer Science. My goal has always been to make a positive impact on people's lives, and throughout my time at Cornell, I've been fortunate enough to work on various projects and contribute to large-scale research efforts. Some of my current undertakings include contributing to Cornell Data Science, exploring and analyzing mutation quantitative trait loci (mutQTLs) as a novel genetic field, and working on this site. In my free time, I like to play and follow tennis, ping-pong, and cricket, and have played the piano for 16 years."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/home/manifest.json"/><meta property="twitter:image" content="/home/social-image.png"/><meta property="og:image" content="/home/social-image.png"/><title>Varun Gande</title><script defer="defer" src="/home/static/js/main.236dd605.js"></script><link href="/home/static/css/main.778eeed7.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
